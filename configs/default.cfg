# X = North-South (positive X is South)

# Z = East-West (positive Z is West)

# This is the percentage of loops in the dungeon. At 0%, each level of 
# the dungeon will be nearly linear, with a few branches, but never 
# any loops. At 100% you will basically get a grid with every room connected
# all of its neighbors. For best results, keep this < 30%. 
# Note that certain room types (rooms larger than 1 tile) will also affect
# the number of possible loops in a level.

max_dist: 19

# This will attempt to place multiple dungeons as far away from each other as
# possible given the min/max values above. Setting this to False will ignore
# distances between dungeons when selecting a location, and give a higher
# probability of two dungeons appearing right next to each other.
maximize_distance: True

# This overrides the placement algorithm, and places a corner of the dungeon
# at this spot.

# The entrance position will be chosen from a random room location, unless
# you use the --entrance option. 
#
# This does not currently check the bounds of the world to make sure the
# dungeon will fit. If you make the dungeon too deep, or too large 
# it will error out.

#
# This list will shortcut at the first match, (ie: once a block matches, we
# won't bother checking the rest) so for maximum efficiency, order this by 
# most common blocks first. The more blocks you list here the slower the 
# initial terrain pass will be. 
#
# These names should match the names in items.txt. To disable this feature,
# just leave this blank.

# Secret rooms. Secret rooms have quite a few restrictions, so set this high

### Materials
#
# Set the materials to use for walls, secret doors, ceilings, floors and
# subfloors here. You can choose most blocks in items.txt, just remove any
# spaces. You can also choose from a variety of "meta materials" that change
# according to position and depth. 
#
# meta_mossycobble: Cobblestone with veins of moss. 
#
# meta_mossystonebrick: Stone bricks with random cracks and veins of moss.
#
# meta_stonedungeon: Changes as you go deeper. Starts as something like mossy
#                    stone bricks and turns to cobble and mossy cobble as
#                    levels get deeper. 
#
# meta_decoratedsandstone: Mostly regular sandstone with random smooth stones
#                          and horizontal bands of "chiseled" sandstone.

### Trap settings 
#
###############################################################################

# Chance of arrow traps. The is the percent chance a hallway will contain
# an arrow trap. Defects adjusts the frequency of exploding arrow traps.
arrow_traps: 3
arrow_trap_defects: 2

# Hallway piston traps. Percent chance that certain halls will contain piston
# traps. To qualify, a hall must be 1-2 blocks wide, at least 8 blocks long,
# and be offset from the edge of the tile by a certain amount, depending on
# the width of the hall. This is fairly rare, so a high value here is
# recommended for best results. 
hall_piston_traps: 25
# This makes hall piston traps reset themselves.
resetting_hall_pistons: True

# Skeleton balconies. Skeleton balconies appear in tall circular pit rooms.
# This is the percent chance a balcony will appear if the conditions are right.
# These only appear in pit rooms that are >= 3 deep and have exactly two adjacent
# halls. If your dungeon is less than FOUR levels, you will not see these. 
skeleton_balconies: 65

# This is the chance certain pit rooms will be rigged with falling sand traps.
# There are a number of restrictions on which rooms can contain these, so 
# setting this fairly high will still result in relatively few rooms depending
# on your config file. 
# To contain a sand trap a pit room must be > 1 level high, and 
# only the top most level in a pit can contain a sand trap.
sand_traps: 60

# Silverfish. This is the percent chance any stone, cobblestone, or stone
# brick block will be replaced with a silverfish equivalent. You can use this
# to discourage tunneling through walls and floors (if your walls and floors
# are mode of stone, cobblestone, or brick)
silverfish: 65

### Feature Lists 
#
###############################################################################

# The following sections control the probability of a particular
# feature showing up in the algorithm. Each  name is followed by a
# weight that determines the probability that feature will be chosen
# relative to the others in the list. These numbers do NOT  need to
# add up to 100. They are only relative to each other. For example,
# a weight of 40 is twice as likely to be chosen as a weight of 20.
# These numbers are also not hard, they simply weight the probability
# of the randomizer. A very low weight may still occasionally be chosen
# more than a high weight, it's just unlikely. A weight of zero means
# that feature will never be chosen.

# Mobs for monster spawners.
#
# These work like look tiers (see below). [mobs.0] are for spawners
# above ground (like inside the pyramid). The highest numbered mob tier is
# reserved for treasure rooms. Note, some treasure rooms have hard coded 
# mobs. The rest will be chosen as the level go deeper. 
#
# There are some non-standard choices here. Choose these at your own
# risk. They may disappear from Minecraft in the future and who knows
# what that will do to old maps containing these entities. 
#
# "Slime" doesn't work well, because they have special depth and chunk
# location requirements. Often, you won't get any slimes at all.
# However, "LavaSlime" (Magma Cubes) seems to work okay as they don't
# have any special spawning requirements.
#
# "PigZombie" works, but they don't care about light level and are mostly
# docile. They will fill up the mob queue quickly and you'll end up with
# few hostile mobs. 
#
# "Wolf" doesn't break, but doesn't usually spawn wolves either. Like
# slimes, wolves have special spawn requirements.
#
# "Ghast" works, but they need a lot of room to move around. The standard
# rooms and corridors are usually too small.
#
# "WitherBoss" works, but they don't often have enough room to spawn and
# when they do it causes a lot of destruction. Not recommended.
#
# Other mob names may also work. See the minecraft wiki for mob names.
#
# Also supplied are some custom spawners. "AngryPig" will give you non
# docile Pigmen. "ChargedCreeper" creepers charged as if struck by
# lightning. "HardZombie" for zombies with a strength effect and 8
# hearts of health. If you're handy with an NBT editor you can make
# your own custom spawners and place them in the spawners directory.
# "CustomKnight" is a zombie with full weapons, armour and a steve
# mask. They are tough.
#
# See: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Chunk_format#Mobs
# 
# This does not affect what critters will spawn naturally within 
# dark areas of the dungeon.

### Loot Tables 
#
###############################################################################

# There are an arbitrary number of loot "tiers"
# Tier zero is used for any chests located above the ceiling of the topmost
# dungeon level. (like the tower) The highest numbered tier is used for a 
# single chest located at the bottom of the dungeon. All other chests are 
# picked from tier 1 to (n-1) depending on the level depth. Item names are
# taken from items.txt file. 
# 
# Lines are:
# Item Name(s): (chance to appear),(min-max),(enchantment)
#
# Where:
# (chance to appear) = Percent chance to appear. ie: 1-100
# (min-max) = number, or range. ie: 4 or 10-20
# (enchant) = Enchant level for items.
#             Can be a number, range, or level*number to scale with levels. 
#
# Examples:
#
# 100% chance of 5-20 torches:
# Torch: 100,5-20
#
# 50% chance of an iron, gold, or diamond level 20 sword:
# Iron Sword,Gold Sword,Diamond Sword: 50,1,20
#
# 20% chance of a stone pickaxe with a level*3.5 enchantment.
# (Level 1 =  level 3 enchant, level 9 = level 31 enchant.)
# Stone Pickaxe: 20,1,level*3.5
